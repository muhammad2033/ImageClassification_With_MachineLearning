# ImageClassification_With_MachineLearning

In image classification, various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are commonly employed. To enhance the performance of these algorithms, feature extraction techniques like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) can be applied. These techniques help capture relevant information from images and improve the discriminatory power of the model.

Consider the scenario where two datasets are utilized for image classification: one comprising cricketer images featuring AB de Villiers and Sam Curran, and another with images of ice cream, balls, and cars. Before applying machine learning algorithms, it is essential to preprocess the data. This may involve unzipping folders containing the images and organizing them appropriately for training and testing.

To initiate the process, the image datasets need to be imported and extracted. For instance, Python's zipfile library can be used to unzip folders containing images. Once unzipped, the datasets can be split into training and testing sets. The cricketer dataset would involve class labels for AB de Villiers and Sam Curran, while the other dataset would have labels for ice cream, balls, and cars.

Following the extraction and organization of the datasets, features can be extracted using techniques like HOG, LBP, and ORB. These features serve as the input for machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set to assess its classification performance. The chosen algorithm, along with suitable feature extraction methods, depends on the characteristics of the datasets and the desired classification accuracy.

# In summary, 
image classification involves unzipping image datasets, extracting relevant features, and employing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, SVM, random forests, and gradient boosting for accurate classification. The effectiveness of these algorithms is further enhanced by incorporating feature extraction techniques like HOG, LBP, and ORB.
